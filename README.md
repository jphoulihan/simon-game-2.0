The Simon Memory Game

The Simon electronic memory skill game, invented in 1978 by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison,
creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds,
the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs
out, the game is over. Simon is named ater the simple children's game of Simon Says, but the
gameplay is based on Atari's unpopular Touch Me arcade game from 1974.

The device has four coloured buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or
activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons
in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the
game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.


Requirements

Re-create a version of the Simon game as a (HTML/CSS/JS) web app. Your app must
implement the interface shown in Figures 1, and only requires implementation of the following
single-player game play.

Figures 1

The Single-Player Simon Game is as follows:

1. Click the START button to begin, the game status indicator (the red/green light below the START
button) switches from RED to GREEN. The game will begin 3s after the light turns GREEN.

2. Simon will give the first signal (randomly flash a coloured buGon). Repeat the signal by clicking the
same colour button.

3. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by clicking the same
colour buttons, in order.

4. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

5. Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly. After the 5th, 9th
and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon automatically speeds up the interval between signals.

6. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal,
Simon responds by flashing all four buttons simultaneously five times. This means you have lost,
and the sequence of signals ends. The game status indicator switches from GREEN to RED and you
will have to click START button to begin a new game.

7. Your progress (the number of correctly repeated signals) for the game just completed (last game)
is shown in the display to the right of the START button. The all-time highest score is shown in the
display to the left of the START button.



Development Notes

1. All game interface elements must be generated using HTML elements together with appropriate
CSS styling. Generally, your colour schemes, must follow a similar colour scheme to that shown in
Figure 1. You may not use pre-constructed images for any of the game elements. All of the
elements shown were created using HTML and CSS in codepen.io, and (for convenience of display
in this document) were combined using Keynote.

2. The position of the interactive and display elements must, in general, be structured as shown in
Figure 1. You cannot use another layer or design for your assignment.

3. The font family used is “Orbitron” and you may load it from hGps://fonts.googleapis.com/. You
may not use any other font as part of the display.

4. You may not use a CSS framework, such as Bootstrap, for this assignment. You may, if you wish,
use the jQuery Javascript framework. If you use TypeScript, or similar, and transpire to JavaScript,
you need to provide all sources. Your app only needs to run on a desktop browser such as Chrome
- you do not need to ensure it works on every browser (mobile browsers, for example).

5. You must comment your code, clearly indicating, how your code implements the Single-Player
Simon game.


Testing Notes

the browser used while developing was a brave chromium browser.

gameplay tested in firefox and google chrome.
